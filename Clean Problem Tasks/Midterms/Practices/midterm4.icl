/* Instructions
You are given 13 exercises each of 10 points. Min 5 perfect solutions (50 points) is required for passed, max is 100 points, you can choose which ones to solve.

Find on local C: drive the Clean compiler.

Copy the text into a  .icl file, save into your documents folder where you can compile.

Only this browser and compiler should be active during programming.

KEEP this browser open until you submit. MULTIPLE  task  taking IS NOT POSSIBLE.

After you finish coding UPLOAD here the file, JUST .icl file, and PRESS SUBMIT.

After SUBMIT the FILE CAN NOT BE CHANGED, MULTIPLE UPLOADS, MULTIPLE SUBMITS IS NOT POSSIBLE.

 

Your submission should not have any errors when running the code.

It is possible to get partial points for not fully working code, but please make sure you comment out the errors.

You should not delete anything from the given code, given test cases should stay the same, but you can add your tests as well.

Don't change the given function signatures, however, you can add as many functions as you wish, just make sure to name them appropriately.

Make sure that you comment all 'Start'-s before submitting the code.

-- it will count as a disciplinary fault.

-- The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal

//// Disarium number
/*1.
Given a positive integer number, check if the given number
is a Disarium number or not.
A Disarium number is a number defined by the following:
Sum of its digits powered with their respective position
is equal to the original number.
Example: 135 is a Disarium number, 1^1+3^2+5^3 = 135.

//// Harshad numbers
/*2.
Given a list of positive integer numbers, return a list that

'c' + 2 = 'e' ... We did the same as above
